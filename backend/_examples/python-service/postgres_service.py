"""
PostgreSQL database configuration and connection management.

This module handles PostgreSQL connection pooling using module-level variables
to reuse connections across Lambda invocations, improving performance and reducing
cold start time.

# Persists between invocations within the same Lambda container

def get_postgres_version(config):
    """
    Retrieves the PostgreSQL version using connection pooling with psycopg3.

    Reuses the module-level PG_CONN across invocations for better performance.
    Executes "SELECT version();" query to retrieve the version string.
    On connection failure or query error, resets the connection to None and raises the error.

    Connection pooling strategy:
    - First invocation: Creates a new connection and stores it in PG_CONN
    - Subsequent invocations: Reuses the existing connection if still open
    - On error: Resets PG_CONN to None to force reconnection on next invocation

    Returns:
        str: The PostgreSQL version string, or "unknown" if retrieval fails

    Raises:
        Exception: If connection or query fails
